This is just a simple to do app, made for testing the functionality of react hooks.
To have a look at the sample follow this link: -> https://gyam28.github.io/todo-react-with-hooks/

The app contains a mock database and the list view split into TO DO and DONE tasks. 
Extra tasks can be added through the bottom "insert to do" field.
